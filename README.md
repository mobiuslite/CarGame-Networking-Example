### Open solution, build in either release or debug x64
### Run UDPTestServer project.
### Right click in solution explorer on CarGameCient

### Do this for how ever many clients you like

# CONTROLS
### W to accelerate
### A-D to turn
### Enter to ready up
### 1-5 to change tick rate of server/client (1hz, 10hz, 100hz, 60hz, 24hz)

# NOTE	
### When creating clients, make sure each client has a unique username, as that is what seperates them when sending info to other clients.

### If the server or client program freezes, please uncheck "Quick Edit" in the console's properties
### This is make the console/program freeze until something is typed in the console.

### If a client is launched and it has a low framerate, restarting the program will fix it. With a low framerate, the server's info sending will lag behind.
